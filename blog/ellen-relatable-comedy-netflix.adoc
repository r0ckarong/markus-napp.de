Ellen Degeneres
Netflix Special
Title: Relatable

(First 5 Minutes)

Starts with completely overexaggerating parts of her normal life by mentioning
various butlers, servants and other serfs. This is meant ot break down the
barrier between the "common" audience and a half a billion dollar net worth
TV host/comedian.

Mentions and uses her sexuality as a lesbian to pass time. Calls out closeted
actors/actresses that they didn't have the guts to come out before or after her.
Completely ignoring that her particular celebrity status enabled her to forego
a lot of the risks of "coming out" in that market. She was already established
as a comedienne and "coming out" wouldn't have changed much about that
recognition. Coming out as an "unknown" actor or comedian would probably have
been much more difficult.

QUESTION: Did she announce being a lesbian before going on Johnny Carson or
after she became famous?

Then she proceeds to simply state: "It would help if a lot more people came out".
Well, yes. But hell, no. The pure act of coming out still means exposition to
discrimination and violence for most LGBTQ people in their communities. Sure,
overall it would be wonderful if everyone could profess their true self to the
world but we do not live in a (global) society where this can happen that easily.
Maybe for a half billionaire this is easy to miss nowadays because the folks
in her circle of perception all have the freedom to choose. I doubt her
suggestions would work well for a lot of teenage village girls in India or gay
Russian teenagers. This is a disgustingly naiively constructed act, fundamentally
ignoring the state of queer rights across the world or for that matter in large
parts of her own country. Ellen assumes that just because SHE made it everyone
can. Sorry, this is just as stupid an assumptions as you hear from the investment
bankers that claim everyone can make millions of dollars if they just invest their
tens of thousands properly. It is based on false assumptions that do not represent
or even touch the fanbase that so fundamentally eat up the messages.

"It's not just actors and actresses. [...] There are gay football players, there are gay
baseball players, there are gay hockey players, there are gay doctors, lawyers,
there are gay hairdressers, you guys."

This joke is based in revisionism.

--Find source for "gay football player"
--Find source for "gay baseball player"
--Find source for "gay hockey player"

Please note how she never even mentions Basketball!

Especially in the sports world, being gay has been a long standing excuse
for abusive behavior, discrimination and various other forms of harrassment.
There are no public statistics on how many athletes are gay. Should we care?
I don't know. Just the fact that we see "former" sports figures coming out as
gay AFTER they have finished their tenure in the sport is disconcerting to me to
say the least. If we had a working and socially accepted understanding of gender
and sexuality we wouldn't have to talk about it because nobody cared. People do
care. But unfortunately on the wrong side. Gay athletes have to leave their field
of expertise before they can dare to "expose" themselves as gay.

I don't understand how Ellen uses this disparity as the punchline for a joke by
mocking its non-existence. If there were as many openly gay football/hockey/baseball
players as she aludes to in this joke, there wouldn't be a problem. The facts
are different. Male driven sports are dominated by a macho culture that
alienates and openly discriminates against gays and queer people.
There is nothing (to my knowledge) that is being done by the official sports
representatives to combat these attitudes. Workshops and pamphlets do not help
here.

Sports officials must decide and declare rules how people are to be treated
with consequences facing those that do not comply. This is not happening.
Money and game results rule the decision making process for putting together
sports teams.

NOTES:
Completely unrelatable
hides behind ramblings to make wealthy people shit sound like everyday problems

Has a segment that shows instagram post videos
why even do that? you do that in your real life because you have literally
nothing else going on or better to do. why the fuck include that in a paid for
comedy special that is meant to entertain people?
1) How devoid of talent are you that you have to use your terrible non verbal
chat interactions with your partner as an example for entertainment?
2) How terrible of a comedian are you to not tell a better story about how this
is the fundamental problem that you (and most of us) can't talk to your spouse
anymore without relying on these shitty superficial nonsense interactions like
pet videos.

FUCK
