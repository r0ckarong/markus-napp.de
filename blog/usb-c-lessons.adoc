* Get an all in one hub for your main workstations. Ethernet, USB 3, HDMI.
* Get a second charger
* Buy a cable for the second charger (yes they don't ship one ... bastards)
* When using an all in one hub on a flat battery your laptop might not receive enough power to boot up. Plug in the charger directly.
* Buy Micro-USB to USB-C converters from China. 10pcs for ~1â‚¬
* Not all USB-C is made to standards. Some china devices have their "own" USB-C ideas and implement longer plugs that work with other devices but won't allow the original device to be used with standard type C cables.
