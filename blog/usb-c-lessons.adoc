= Lessons in using a USB-C MacBook

* Get a all in one hub for your main workstations. Ethernet, USB 3, HDMI.
* Get a second charger
* Buy a cable for the second charger (yes they don't ship one ... bastards)
* When using an all in one hub on a flat battery your laptop might not receive enough power to boot up. Plug in the charger directly.
