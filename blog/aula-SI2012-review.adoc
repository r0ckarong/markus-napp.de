Weird Key layout
Mixture of 87 ANSI and 88 ISO, has 88 keys but is NOT an ISO layout.
It has a long left Shift and a Backslash/Large ISO Enter
Weird stabilizers
Springs under the Space bar
Blue imitation switches
Feel very clicky like the real Cherry MX
One LED for CAPS indicator above the arrow keys
keycaps have a longer stem, normal caps will bottom out on the sides on press
incredibly cheap
Solid long USB cable
Shipping around 2 weeks from China
Media keys on F1-F8
