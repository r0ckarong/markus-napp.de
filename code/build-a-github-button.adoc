= How to build a custom "Improve this Content" button

Inspired by this blog post: http://ben.balter.com/2015/09/13/github-pages-edit-button/

I wanted to build a button for our company documentation project.
Since the pages are process with AsciiBinder and have a slightly less intuitive structure than the GitHub pages model I needed to write some JavaScript to actually find the correct branch and URL to forward to.

The script I ended up building is this:

[source,javascript]
----
jQuery(document).ready(function($){ # <1>

  what = window.location.href.split(':'); # <2>
  a = document.getElementById('improve'); # <3>

  if (what[0] == "file") # <4>
   {
     a.href = "https://github.com/arago/hiro-documentation/"
   } else { # <5>
       branch = "/" + window.location.href.split(window.location.host)[1].split('/')[2] + "/"
       file = window.location.href.split(window.location.host)[1].split('/').slice(3).join('/')
       url = file.substring(file.length -5,0) + ".adoc"
       a.href = "https://github.com/arago/hiro-documentation/edit" + branch + url # <6>
     };
});
----
<1> Run once document is loaded
<2> Find out the location
<3> Find the anchor/button element to replace
<4> Check if it's local, if so insert a default link
<5> Otherwise split the location into sections, find the branch and file name, truncate the .html ending, add .adoc ending
<6> Assemble into full URL and insert into "href" element of the selected anchor
